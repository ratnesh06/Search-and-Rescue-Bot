## Search-and-Rescue-Bot
This project involves the design and development of an autonomous robot capable of navigating a maze and detecting and collecting objects (tennis balls) in a simulated search and rescue operation using an allocated budget as a part of the course ME545 at Penn State. The robot is built using LEGO components and employs various sensors (ultrasonic, webcam) to detect walls and objects.

## Key features include:
###
* **Wall Following**: The robot follows the left wall using a finite state machine (FSM) to navigate.
* **Object Detection and Collection**: Utilizes OpenCV and Raspberry Pi for image processing to locate and collect objects.  
* **Control System**: Arduino manages motor control and sensor data, while a Raspberry Pi handles computation and communication.  
* **Ball Collection Mechanism**: A servo-driven mechanism for collecting tennis balls.  

The project focuses on integrating hardware (LEGO, Raspberry Pi, Arduino) and software (Python, OpenCV) to create a fully autonomous system. We designed the Lego chassis to ensure it was capable of manoeuvring through the pathways of the maze without getting stuck and implemented a finite state machine (FSM) to manage the robot's behaviours effectively for wall following.
